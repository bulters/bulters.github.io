      <description>Advent of Code 2019, day 2 So day one went fairly smooth. Nothing too difficult to impoement, as you can expect from a first challenge. Since I&amp;rsquo;ve done some of the challenges last year (implemented them in Go), I know that there will be a rapid ramp-up in difficulty and that a number of challenges build &amp;ldquo;on top of each other&amp;rdquo;. Perfect opportunities to start exploring how to write reuseable Haskell code.</description>

      <description>Introduction For the past few years I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to learn haskell in various ways but have never been able to stick to the method, let alone actually &amp;ldquo;become productive&amp;rdquo; in Haskell.
Since I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to spent more time on tinkering during the evenings, I thought it would be a nice idea to document my learning process.
The general idea is that I will do the challenges from the Advent of Code (2020 edition) and implement them in Haskell.</description>
